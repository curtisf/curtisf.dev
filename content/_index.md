# Hey there! I'm Curtis
I'm a senior year Computer Science student at [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://www.vcu.edu/). 

I'm interested in several areas of Computer Science, but primarily work on web and API development. I'm also particularly interested in effective infrastructure development and dealing with scale.

In my free time, I maintain [Logger](https://github.com/curtisf/logger), a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot operating in 198,000 servers.

Programming languages in order of competence:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Golang
- TypeScript
- C
- Rust
